## Problem 1.4.14

If $x/(x-2) \le 3$, then $x < 2$ or $x \ge 3$, where $x$ is a real number.  

To establish the logic for the proof we start by defining are statements $p$ and $q$.

$$
p: \frac{x}{x-2} \le 3  
$$


$$
q: x \ge 3 \ \text{or} \ x < 2  
$$


Converting the original statement above into short hand we get,

$$
p \Rightarrow q
$$


**Proof:**

We prove this directly by letting $p$ be true,

$$
\frac{x}{x-2} \le 3
$$

For simplicity we solve for $x$ by multiplying $(x-2)$ on both sides of the inequality.

$$
x \le 3(x-2)
$$

Distributing the 3,

$$
x \le 3x - 6  
$$

Subtract $x$ and add 6 to both sides,

$$
6 \le 2x
$$

Divide by 2 so that $p$ becomes,

$$
x \ge 3  
$$

Now consider the implication $p \Rightarrow q$

$$
x \ge 3 \ \text{implies} \ x \ge 3 \ \text{or} \ x < 2  
$$

Since $p$ is true we know that $x \ge 3$ which will also make the consequent true.  

$$
